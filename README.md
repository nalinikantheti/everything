***THREE THINGS I WOULD CHANGE***

1. The biggest improvement I could see happening in this codebase is implementing error handling. Obviously, it wasn't included in the tutorial, but even rudimentary error handling like try catch blocks, or console log statements would immediately improve the future proofing of this codebase 100 fold.
2. Input validation. This was mentioned in the prompt but that doesn't undermine it's importance. It would immediately improve the codebase to validate the URL format to not only increase ease of use but to prevent vulnerabilities such as SQL injection attacks. This could be done with a library or framework
3. Implementing URL analytics. this isn't necessary but it coul dbe super cool to track and analyze URL usage by capturing and storing metrics such as the number of times a shortened URL is accessed, timestamps, referral information, and user agents.
